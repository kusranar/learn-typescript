tsc to compile typescript to javascript

advantage typescript:
- become static type
- next-gen javascript feature(compiled down for older browsers)
- super feature (like interface, generics)
- meta-programming feature like decorator
- rich configuration options
- modern tooling that helps even in non-typescript projects


tsc app.ts --watch / or / tsc app.ts -w     ==> for watch mode, and no use syntax more and more
tsc init    ==> tsc        ==> like --watch but compile all file and you can combine with --watch or watch
